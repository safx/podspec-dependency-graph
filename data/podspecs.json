{"zipzap":{"name":"zipzap","version":"7.0","summary":"zipzap is a zip file I/O library for Mac OS X and iOS.","description":"The zip file is an ideal container for compound Objective-C documents. Zip files are widely used and well understood. You can randomly access their parts. The format compresses decently and has extensive operating system and tool support. So we want to make this format an even easier choice for you. Thus, the library features:\n\n- Easy-to-use interface: The public API offers just three classes! Yet you can look through zip files using familiar NSArray collections and properties. And you can zip, unzip and rezip zip files through familiar NSData, NSStream and Image I/O classes.\n- Efficient implementation: We've optimized zip file reading and writing to reduce virtual memory pressure and disk file thrashing. Depending on how your compound document is organized, updating a single entry can be faster than writing the same data to a separate file.\n- File format compatibility: Since zipzap closely follows the zip file format specification, it is works with most Mac, Linux and Windows zip tools.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/pixelglow/zipzap","authors":"Pixelglow

Contributor Grant.\n     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor\n     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\n\n          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,\n          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\n          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an\n          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code\n          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or\n          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone\n          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions\n          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have\n          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that\n          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of\n          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor\n          Version (or portions of such combination).\n\n          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are\n          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of\n          the Covered Code.\n\n          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;\n          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of\n          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made\n          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the\n          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims\n          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by\n          that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n     3.1. Application of License.\n     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\n     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n     Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications.\n     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n          (a) Third Party Claims.\n          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\n          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n          distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Contributor APIs.\n          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n               (c)    Representations.\n          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n          this License.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices.\n     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n     terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works.\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n     understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions.\n     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised\n     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\n     will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n     Covered Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\n     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",\n     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\n     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\n     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\n     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\n     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\n     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n     this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n     shall survive.\n\n     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n     You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n     the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n     Participant.\n\n     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n     license.\n\n     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n     prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n     The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n     software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n     rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n     License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n     \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n     ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License\n     Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in\n     compliance with the License.

It’s got JSON documents, and the same map/reduce as Couchbase Server, in a pint-sized edition.\n\n  Couchbase Lite compiles natively for iOS and Android. Half a megabyte optimized, for quick launch and snappy user experience on occasionally connected devices when data matters.\n\n  **Lightweight** means:\n\n  * Embedded: The database engine is a library linked into the app, not a separate server process.\n  * Small code size: currently under 600kbytes. This is important to mobile apps, which are often downloaded over cell networks.\n  * Quick startup time on relatively-slow CPUs: currently under 50ms on recent iPhones.\n  * Low memory usage with typical mobile data-sets. The expectation is the number of documents will not be huge, although there may be sizable multimedia attachments.\n  * \"Good enough\" performance with these CPUs and data-sets. (Exact figures depend on your data and application, of course.)\n\n  **Document-oriented** means:\n\n  * Like Couchbase Server, it stores records in flexible [JSON](http://json.org) format instead of requiring predefined schemas or normalization.\n  * Records/documents can have arbitrary-sized binary attachments, like multimedia content.\n  * Your application's data format can evolve over time without any need for explicit migrations.\n  * Map/reduce indexing allows fast lookups without needing to use special query languages.\n  * Documents can contain free-form text or geographic coordinates, which are efficiently indexed for full-text search or geo-querying.\n\n  **[Syncable](http://syncable.org/)** means:\n\n  * Any two copies of a database can be brought into sync via an efficient, reliable, proven REST-based [protocol][23].\n  * Sync can be on-demand or continuous (with a latency of a few seconds).\n  * The sync engine supports intermittent and unreliable network connections.\n  * Conflicts can be detected and resolved, with app logic in full control of merging.\n  * Revision trees allow for complex replication topologies, including server-to-server (for multiple data centers) and peer-to-peer, without data loss or false conflicts.\n\n  The native APIs are Objective-C (iOS, Mac) and Java (Android), but an optional internal REST API adapter allows it to be called from other languages like JavaScript and C#, for use in apps built with PhoneGap, Titanium or MonoTouch.\n"},"cocos2d":{"name":"cocos2d","license":"MIT","version":"2.1-rc2","summary":"cocos2d for iPhone is a framework for building 2D games, demos, and other graphical/interactive applications.","description":"cocos2d for iPhone is a framework for building 2D games, demos, and other graphical/interactive applications for iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad and Mac.

The API is also highly efficient, as it adds only a thin layer of third party code and is engineered for maximum performance (for example, by automatically adding constraints to the nearest ancestor view).\n\n            API Cheat Sheet\n            ---------------\n\n            This is just a handy overview of the core API methods. Check out the [header file](https://github.com/smileyborg/UIView-AutoLayout/blob/master/Source/UIView%2BAutoLayout.h) for the full API and documentation. A couple notes:\n\n            *\t*All of the API methods begin with `auto...` for easy autocompletion!*\n            *\t*All methods that generate constraints also automatically add the constraint(s) to the correct view, then return the newly created constraint(s) for you to optionally store for later adjustment or removal.*\n            *\t*Many methods below also have a variant which includes a `relation:` parameter to make the constraint an inequality.*\n\n            **UIView**\n\n            *\t+ autoRemoveConstraint(s):\n            *\t- autoRemoveConstraintsAffectingView(AndSubviews)\n            *\t+ autoSetPriority:forConstraints:\n            *   - autoSetContent(CompressionResistance | Hugging)PriorityForAxis:\n            *\t- autoCenterInSuperview:\n            *\t- autoAlignAxisToSuperviewAxis:\n            *\t- autoPinEdgeToSuperviewEdge:withInset:\n            *\t- autoPinEdgesToSuperviewEdges:withInsets:(excludingEdge:)\n            *\t- autoPinEdge:toEdge:ofView:(withOffset:)\n            *\t- autoAlignAxis:toSameAxisOfView:(withOffset:)\n            *\t- autoMatchDimension:toDimension:ofView:(withOffset: | withMultiplier:)\n            *\t- autoSetDimension(s)ToSize:\n            *\t- autoConstrainAttribute:toAttribute:ofView:(withOffset: | withMultiplier:)\n            *\t- autoPinTo(Top | Bottom)LayoutGuideOfViewController:withInset:\n\n            **NSArray**\n\n            *\t- autoAlignViewsToEdge:\n            *\t- autoAlignViewsToAxis:\n            *\t- autoMatchViewsDimension:\n            *\t- autoSetViewsDimension:toSize:\n            *\t- autoDistributeViewsAlongAxis:withFixedSpacing:alignment:\n            *\t- autoDistributeViewsAlongAxis:withFixedSize:alignment:\n\n            **NSLayoutConstraint**\n\n            *\t- autoRemove\n","homepage":"https://github.com/smileyborg/UIView-AutoLayout","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Tyler Fox":"tfox@smileyborg.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/smileyborg/UIView-AutoLayout.git","tag":"v1.3.0"},"source_files":"Source","requires_arc":true},"UITextView+UIControl":{"name":"UITextView+UIControl","summary":"A UIControl-like API addition to UITextView.","homepage":"https://github.com/andrewsardone/UITextView-UIControl","source":{"git":"https://github.com/andrewsardone/UITextView-UIControl.git","tag":"0.1.0"},"version":"0.1.0","authors":{"Andrew Sardone":"andrew@andrewsardone.com"},"license":"MIT","source_files":"Classes","platforms":{"ios":null}},"UITextView+PinchZoom":{"name":"UITextView+PinchZoom","version":"0.1.2","summary":"Simple pinch-zoom category for UITextView.","homepage":"https://github.com/cfr/UITextView-PinchZoom","license":{"type":"WTFPL","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Stan Serebryakov":"cfr@gmx.us"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cfr/UITextView-PinchZoom.git","tag":"0.1.2"},"platforms":{"ios":"4.3"},"source_files":"UITextView+PinchZoom.{h, m}"},"UITextSubClass":{"name":"UITextSubClass","version":"0.0.6","summary":"UITextField/UITextView SubClass library.","homepage":"https://github.com/azu/UITextSubClass","screenshots":"http://f.cl.ly/items/2O0W2X3e1j3z1a2h3Y0J/UITextWithDatepicker.png","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"azu":"info@efcl.info"},"platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/azu/UITextSubClass.git","tag":"0.0.6"},"requires_arc":true,"subspecs":[{"name":"Core","resource_bundles":{"UITextSubClassLocalize":["UITextSubClass/*.lproj"]},"source_files":"UITextSubClass/UITextSubClassHelper.{h,m}"},{"name":"UITextFieldWithPickerBase","source_files":"UITextSubClass/UITextFieldWithPickerBase/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"UITextSubClass/Core":[]}},{"name":"UITextFieldWithDatePicker","source_files":"UITextSubClass/UITextFieldWithDatePicker/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"UITextSubClass/UITextFieldWithPickerBase":[]}},{"name":"UITextFieldWithPicker","source_files":"UITextSubClass/UITextFieldWithPicker/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"UITextSubClass/UITextFieldWithPickerBase":[]}},{"name":"UITextFieldWithDecimalPad","source_files":"UITextSubClass/UITextFieldWithDecimalPad/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"UITextSubClass/Core":[]}},{"name":"UITextFieldWithNumberPad","source_files":"UITextSubClass/UITextFieldWithNumberPad/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"UITextSubClass/Core":[]}},{"name":"UITextFieldWithToolbar","source_files":"UITextSubClass/UITextFieldWithToolbar/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"UITextSubClass/Core":[]}},{"name":"UITextViewWithToolbar","source_files":"UITextSubClass/UITextViewWithToolbar/*.{h,m}","dependencies":{"UITextSubClass/Core":[]},"frameworks":"QuartzCore"}]},"UITextField-Blocks":{"name":"UITextField-Blocks","version":"1.0.0","summary":"Adds blocks to all UITextField delegate methods with a category, no subclassing.

This add-on smoothes the way of extracting images from a sprite sheet (texture atlas).\n\nThis can be useful in UIImageView animations where animationImages array has to be filled with a set of images representing frames. UIImage-Sprite category makes this process trivial by introducing two methods:\n\n\t-(NSArray *)spritesWithSpriteSheetImage:(UIImage *)image spriteSize:(CGSize)size;\n\t-(NSArray *)spritesWithSpriteSheetImage:(UIImage *)image inRange:(NSRange)range spriteSize:(CGSize)size;\n\nHow to\n=======\n\nThere are two methods in UIImage+Sprite category. First one:\n\n\t-(NSArray *)spritesWithSpriteSheetImage:(UIImage *)image spriteSize:(CGSize)size;\n\nThe method returns an array with UIImages. Original sprite sheet (image) is sliced into smaller chunks, each of the specified size. \n\nSecond method is very similar:\n\n\t-(NSArray *)spritesWithSpriteSheetImage:(UIImage *)image inRange:(NSRange)range spriteSize:(CGSize)size;\n\nThis method does exactly the same thing as the latter. However, this time we can specify the range of the chunks we want to get.\n\nNote that for performance reasons you should not fire these methods every time you want to get the array of animation frames. You should rather fire it once and store the output array somewhere. This is because the Core Graphics image manipulation operations (especially on large images) are not so fast and your application may slow down.\n\nI wrote this add-on to facilitate the setup of short animations using UIImageView. For more complex animations I recommend using OpenGLES. \n \nDemo\n=======\n\nSpriteAnimationDemo project presents the usage of the UIImage+Sprite methods. The example shows how to create an animated UIImageView. This cool explosion sprite sheet which I included in the demo can be found at http://gushh.net/blog/free-game-sprites-explosion-3/. I added some numbers to this image to make testing and debugging easier.\n","homepage":"http://github.com/r3econ/UIImage-Sprite-Additions","screenshots":"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7121070/github/UIImage-Sprite-Additions/1.png","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Rafał Sroka":"rafal.sroka.it@gmail.com"},"social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/r3econ","platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/r3econ/UIImage-Sprite-Additions.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"source_files":["Classes/*.{h,m}","SpriteAnimationDemo/**/*.{h,m}"],"frameworks":"CoreGraphics","requires_arc":true},"UIImage+RTTint":{"name":"UIImage+RTTint","version":"1.0.0","authors":{"Ramon Torres":"raymondjavaxx@gmail.com"},"homepage":"https://github.com/raymondjavaxx/UIImage-RTTint","summary":"Retina-aware category for tinting, darkening and lightening a UIImage.","source":{"git":"https://github.com/raymondjavaxx/UIImage-RTTint.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source_files":"UIImage+RTTint.{m,h}"},"UIImage+PDF":{"name":"UIImage+PDF","version":"1.1.3","license":{"type":"custom","text":"                Copyright 2012 Nigel Timothy Barber - @mindbrix. \n\n                All rights reserved.\n\n                Permission is given to use this source code file without charge in any project, commercial or otherwise, entirely at your risk, with the condition that any redistribution (in part or whole) of source code must retain this copyright and permission notice.

for iOS applications.\n\nIt reduces the number of steps required for translating an app to the absolute minimum. All you need to do is to include the Tr8n header file in your app, initialize the SDK and use the various translation methods to mark your content for translation.\n\nThe SDK comes with its own language selector, where users can switch languages. Or you can use the language set by the OS.\n\nIt also comes with In-App Translator - where you can ask your users to help translate your app right from within your app!\n\nTr8n SDK integrates with tr8nhub.com service, where you can manage the entire translation process - enable languages, invite translators, manage phrases, and much more.\n\nOnce the translations are done, they will be automatically downloaded and installed by the SDK in your app. Everything is done real-time - you DO NOT need to submit a new application to the App Store. You can simply enable a new language on tr8nhub service and it will immediately be available in the language selector of your application.\n\nYou can learn more about the SDK by running the following sample applications:\n\nDemo app that comes with the SDK:\nhttps://github.com/tr8n/tr8n_objc_clientsdk/tree/master/Project \n\n“Wammer” application that shows how the SDK can be integrated into a messaging app:\nhttps://github.com/tr8n/tr8n_samples_wammer\n\n","screenshots":["http://wiki.tr8nhub.com/images/thumb/c/ca/Ios_welcome.png/338px-Ios_welcome.png","http://wiki.tr8nhub.com/images/thumb/5/58/Ios_menu.png/338px-Ios_menu.png","http://wiki.tr8nhub.com/images/thumb/a/ae/Ios_data_tokens.png/338px-Ios_data_tokens.png","http://wiki.tr8nhub.com/images/thumb/8/88/Ios_decoration_tokens.png/338px-Ios_decoration_tokens.png","http://wiki.tr8nhub.com/images/thumb/0/01/Ios_combined_tokens.png/338px-Ios_combined_tokens.png","http://wiki.tr8nhub.com/images/thumb/0/00/Ios_tml_translator.png/338px-Ios_tml_translator.png","http://wiki.tr8nhub.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Ios_language_selector.png/338px-Ios_language_selector.png","http://wiki.tr8nhub.com/images/thumb/d/d4/Ios_translator.png/338px-Ios_translator.png"],"license":"MIT","authors":{"Michael Berkovich":"michael@tr8nhub.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/tr8n/tr8n_objc_clientsdk.git","tag":"0.1.7"},"social_media_url":"https://twitter.com/tr8nhub","platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Classes","ios":{"exclude_files":"Classes/osx"},"osx":{"exclude_files":"Classes/ios"},"public_header_files":"Classes/**/*.h","dependencies":{"AFNetworking":["~> 2.0.3"],"MPColorTools":["~> 1.4.1"],"MBProgressHUD":["~> 0.8"]}},"TownPlan":{"name":"TownPlan","version":"0.0.1","summary":"Is a UIView layout helper.","homepage":"https://github.com/peterp/TownPlan","license":"MIT","authors":{"Peter Pistorius":"peterp@appfactory.co.za"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/peterp/TownPlan.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"platforms":{"ios":5},"source_files":["Classes","src/*.{h,m}"],"frameworks":"UIKit","requires_arc":true},"Touchstone":{"name":"Touchstone","version":"0.2","summary":"Easy defaults for use in debugging and production.","description":"      Touchstone makes it easy to create defaults that are persistent in debug builds, while being volatile in non-debug builds.\n\n      In non-debug builds, defaults specified as volatile, are not persisted but can be written and read from.

When the user taps to open the side menu the user's main context slides to the right (or left in some implementations) to display another view below. This works well in iOS 6 and before. What does it mean for iOS 7?\n\n  With iOS 7, apps are encouraged to use the whole screen and not rely on the 20pt status bar to be outside of the plane of your app. This breaks the existing side bar idea in that the status bar now lives over two view contexts with a single style.\n\n  Working with the team at Luvocracy, we needed to find a way to show a side menu for our iOS 7 release. Many designers on Dribbble began looking at a new approach for side bars. Inspired by this we worked up a quick prototype that slides the view to the right and scales revealing the menu as seen in the dribbble samples above. Moving forward from this idea and inspired by other ideas from iOS 7 we changed it from a slide to more of a viewport change.\n","homepage":"http://github.com/twotoasters/TWTSideMenuViewController","license":{"type":"MIT"},"authors":{"Josh Johnson":"josh@jnjosh.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/twotoasters/TWTSideMenuViewController.git","tag":"v0.3"},"source_files":"TWTSideMenuViewController","requires_arc":true},"TWStatus":{"name":"TWStatus","version":"0.0.1","summary":"Show notification status on Status bar mimicking Sunrise and Mailbox","homepage":"https://github.com/petersantino/TWStatus","license":"MIT","authors":{"Thanakrit Weekhamchai":"peter@clbs.co.th"},"platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/petersantino/TWStatus.git","commit":"31123335653c8940121d79368fee1897fdb467cd"},"source_files":"TWStatus/*.{h,m}","requires_arc":true,"frameworks":["UIKit","Foundation"]},"TWSReleaseNotesView":{"name":"TWSReleaseNotesView","version":"1.2.0","summary":"A simple way to show in-app release notes in your iOS applications.","description":"Among other crazy features, iOS 7 enables users to have automatic updates for their apps, wiping away the infamous App Store badge.

`UICollectionView+TLTransitioning` category that combine to solve a couple of problems with layout transitions:\n\n                    1. `UICollectionViewLayoutTransition` does not handle content offset well, often leaving cells where you don't want them. `TLTransitionLayout` provides elegant control of content offset with Minimal, Center, Top, Left, Bottom or Right placement options relative to one or more index paths.\n\n                    2. `-[UICollectionView setCollectionViewLayout:animated:completion]` has [serious known bugs][3] in iOS7 and does not provide any animation options. TLLayoutTransitioning provides a robust alternative to this API with support for animation duration, 30+ easing curves and content offset control. This is done by using `CADisplayLink` to drive an interactive `TLTransitionLayout` as a non-interactive animation.\n\n                    Check out the demos in the Examples workspace!\n","homepage":"github.com/wtmoose/TLLayoutTransitioning","license":{"type":"MIT"},"authors":{"wtmoose":"wtm@tractablelabs.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/wtmoose/TLLayoutTransitioning.git","tag":"0.0.2"},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"source_files":"TLLayoutTransitioning/**/*.{h,m,c}","frameworks":["UIKit","QuartzCore","Foundation"],"requires_arc":true},"TLIndexPathTools":{"name":"TLIndexPathTools","version":"0.2.1","summary":"TLIndexPathTools is a small set of classes that can greatly simplify your table and collection views.","description":"\t\t\t\t\tTLIndexPathTools is a small set of classes that can greatly simplify your table and collection views.

It is\n    not possible to modify and generate valid XML from a TBXML object\n    and no validation is performed whatsoever whilst importing and\n    parsing an XML document.\n  ","source_files":["TBXML-Code/*.{h,m}","TBXML-Headers/*.{h,m}"],"libraries":"z","requires_arc":true,"xcconfig":{"GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS":"$(inherited) ARC_ENABLED"}},"TBQuadTree":{"name":"TBQuadTree","version":"0.0.2","summary":"Quad tree data structure build in C.","homepage":"https://github.com/theocalmes/TBQuadTree.git","license":"MIT","authors":{"Theodore Calmes":"theo@thoughtbot.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/theocalmes/TBQuadTree.git","tag":"0.0.2"},"source_files":"TBQuadTree/**/*.{m,h}","requires_arc":true},"TBMacros":{"name":"TBMacros","version":"0.2","platforms":{"ios":"4.0"},"license":"MIT","summary":"A collection of Objective-C syntatic sugar","homepage":"https://github.com/twobitlabs/TBMacros","authors":{"Two Bit Labs":"contact@twobitlabs.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/twobitlabs/TBMacros.git","tag":"0.2"},"requires_arc":false,"source_files":"Macros.h"},"TBMInspectorView":{"name":"TBMInspectorView","version":"1.0.1","platforms":{"osx":"10.6"},"authors":{"Thore Bartholomäus":"thore.bar@googlemail.com"},"license":{"type":"MIT"},"homepage":"https://github.com/trbtm/TBMInspectorView","summary":"TBMInspectorView is a copy of the Xcode 5s inspector view.","source":{"git":"https://github.com/trbtm/TBMInspectorView.git","tag":"v1.0.1"},"source_files":"Classes/*.{h,m}","requires_arc":false},"TBLCategories":{"name":"TBLCategories","version":"0.3","platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"license":"MIT","summary":"Some useful Objective-C categories","homepage":"https://github.com/twobitlabs/TBLCategories","authors":{"Two Bit Labs":"contact@twobitlabs.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/twobitlabs/TBLCategories.git","tag":"0.3"},"requires_arc":false,"source_files":"*.{h,m}"},"TBImagePickerController":{"name":"TBImagePickerController","version":"1.0.0","summary":"A UIImagePickerController that displays a UIActionSheet to select the source type (camera or library) if the current device has a camera.","homepage":"https://github.com/codebrickie/TBImagePickerController","license":"Apache License, Version 2.0","authors":{"Tobias Bayer":"tobayer@googlemail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/codebrickie/TBImagePickerController.git","tag":"1.0.0"},"platforms":{"ios":null},"source_files":["Classes","*.{h,m}"],"requires_arc":true},"TBCoreDataCollectionViewController":{"name":"TBCoreDataCollectionViewController","version":"0.0.1","summary":"A CoreData backed CollectionViewController subclass","description":"                   A CoreData backed CollectionViewController subclass\n","homepage":"https://github.com/tasboa/TBCoreDataCollectionViewController","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Tasboa":"github@tasboa.com","Vasco d'Orey":"vasco.orey@gmail.com"},"social_media_url":"http://twitter.com/tasboa_software","platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/tasboa/TBCoreDataCollectionViewController.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"source_files":"TBCoreDataCollectionViewController/TBCoreDataCollectionViewController.{h,m}","exclude_files":"TBCoreDataCollectionViewController/Exclude","frameworks":"CoreData","requires_arc":true},"TBCollectionCanvas":{"name":"TBCollectionCanvas","version":"0.1.3","summary":"A canvas displaying views that can be moved and connected.","description":"                       This project contains a canvas with moveable nodes.

Basic purpose of this component is to enable binding between models and Views without having to write a lot of unnecessary code which handels everything.\n\n\t`SKBindingManager` allows you to dynamically add or remove bindings. You can specify wheather you would like one-way or two-way binding. It has an integrated support for cycle detection in your bindings. For instance if you have object `A` with properties `a`, `b` and `c`. You will not be allowed to make bindings like this `A.a -> A.b -> A.c -> A.a` because that would cause bindings to refresh themselves indefinetly.

But what about users who like an app?  How many apps have you reviewed?  It probably isn't that many even if you are happy with many of the apps that you are using.  So what happens to users who are perfectly happy with an app and continue to use it?  They probably never provide a review.\n\nIn order for a user to actually post a review, they have to be very motivated to do so or it has to be EXTREMELY easy.  If they aren't motivated, they won't bother.  *Review Request* is designed to make it extremely easy to review an app.  Once your user has a chance to use your newest version they are asked to post a review.  How long before prompting is up to _you_ the developer.\n\nRemember this won't make your app any better.  It will just make it easier for people to review.  If your app is bad, expect more negative feedback.  If you app is good, hopefully you will see more positive feedback.\n\n###Adding the code to your project\nEither add `ReviewRequest.xcproj` to your project or directly add `ReviewRequest.m` and `ReviewRequest.h`.\n\nAll user visible text is exposed as properties so it can be customized for your application and fit in to your localization story.  All properties are documented in the header file.\n\n###Configuring your app\nTo ask for a rating, just add the following code to your startup path.  Don't worry about spamming the user.  You can configure the number of launches before requesting a review as well as the minimum amount of time between first launch and the request.  This will only prompt once per version.  (See the documentation in the header.)  The defaults require that the user launch your app at least 12 times and that at least 23 hours have passed since the first launch.\n\n    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"insert your URL here\"];\n    ReviewRequest *reviewRequest = [[ReviewRequest alloc] initWithItunesUrl:url];\n    [reviewRequest askForReviewIfNeeded];\n\n###Getting your app's App Store URL\nYou can get the URL for your app by following these steps:\n  - Open iTunes an select the iTunes store\n  - Enter your app's name in the search box.  Press enter.\n  - Control click on your app and select \"Copy iTunes Store URL\" from the context menu.\n\nThat will look something like the following:\n`http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google+/id12345?mt=8`\n\nThis will launch the App Store and open the page about your app.  However, you can even do better.  If you use the following format, the user will be taken directly ratings for your app.  However, make sure you change the 12345 for your app's ID.  You will find the ID in the URL that you copied from iTunes.\n`itms-apps://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewContentsUserReviews?type=Purple+Software&id=12345`\n\n*You must test this on a device and not on the simulator, the App Store is not installed on the simulator.*\n\n#####Review Request is based on the work of Games From Within.

makes adding network fetchers to a controlling class simple and painless.\n\nOperationsRunner.h enumerates the handful of steps required. Once added, you instantiate subclasses of the WebFetcher class, configure them, then schedule then to run. Fetchers message one sific method in your control class, returning either the requested data (or response for a POST), or a failure indication.\n \nReasons to use this project:\n- Empower any class you want to perform asynchronous HTTP activity easily and quickly.\n- Lightweight - only a few hundred lines of code. Enable the log messages to see EXACTLY what is happening.\n- With one message, you can essentially tear down all current sessions and activity (e.g., user hit the Back button).\n- Use a hierarchy of WebFetcher subclasses to add increasing complexity. The fetchers can perform processing functions, e.g. resize images, in the same background queue used by the fetcher.\n- Do you really want to use some huge bloated framework, where you have no control or even understanding.\n- Look at URfetcher7 and URSessionDelegate for an example of how to specialize (subclass) WebFetcher and ORSessionDelegate restively.\n\n"},"OperationPromise":{"name":"OperationPromise","version":"0.0.1","summary":"NSOperation(NSOperationQueue) dependency manager library.","homepage":"https://github.com/azu/OperationPromise","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"azu":"info@efcl.info"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/azu/OperationPromise.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"source_files":"OperationPromise/*.{h,m}","requires_arc":true},"OpenXMSDK":{"name":"OpenXMSDK","platforms":{"ios":null},"version":"1.4.1","summary":"OpenX SDK for iOS v1.4.1","description":"The OpenX SDK for iOS allows a user of the OpenX Ad Server to incorporate ads into their iOS applications.","homepage":"http://www.openx.com","authors":"OpenX Technologies, Inc. | maintained by @lawrenceleach","license":{"type":"commercial","text":"Copyright 2013 OpenX Technologies, Inc.

Unlike existing device identification schemes, ODIN is:\n\n                    - **Anonymous** A device’s ODIN does not encode any additional information beyond differentiating it from other ODINs. Having a single ODIN does not reveal any information about the originating device’s user, make, model, etc.\n                    - **Consistent** ODIN provides a standardized format for identifying devices regardless of software platform. Thus iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and future devices all use the same number format.\n                    - **Secure** The ODIN specification considers device identifiers to be personal information and details precautions in its transport accordingly.

The important API is a single method:\n\n    + (instancetype)startWithContentsOfDirectoryAtURL:(NSURL *)url;\n\nAll you do is put a bunch of files in a particular format (more on that later) and a `.tail` file extension in a directory and pass the URL of that directory to Mocktail.

([HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) thought it was going to be up to the task, but it's for forensic analysis of what happened during requests, not what came back.)\n\nSo we made one up. It's newline-delimited.\n\n**Line 1** is a regular expression that matches the HTTP method. Something like `GET` or `GET|POST` or `.*` will work.\n\n**Line 2** is a regular expression that matches the full URL of the HTTP request. So something like `http://yourserver.com:1234/very/specific/path?param1=value1` or maybe just `/partial/path/to/something/.*` is fine too.\n\n**Line 3** is the HTTP status code of the response. Probably `200`.\n\n**Line 4** is the HTTP/MIME content type of the content. `application/json; charset=utf-8` is a nice value for this line, as is `text/html`. If you want to send back binary data, your best bet is to suffix this line with `;base64` and then to Base64-encode the response body.\n\n**Line 5** is blank.\n\nEverything after the newline ending line 5 (that is to say, line 6 and on) is sent back as the response body, either verbatim or Base64-decoded, depending on what you put on line 4. Unless you use the placeholder support, but more on that later.\nIt doesn't even matter what the filename is as long as it ends in `.tail`. You just use one of these files per mock response \"endpoint\" and Mocktail loads them all in when you start it.\n\n## Placeholder support\n\nOh, so you wanted your mock responses to be smarter? That's not very slacker-like.\n\nHere's whatcha do.\n\n**1.** Keep track of that object you got back from calling `startWithContentsOfDirectoryAtURL:`\n\n**2.** Add a template tag to your mock response:\n\n    {{ foo }}\n\n**3.** Use that nifty Objective-C key-value setting syntax to set some keys and values:\n\n    Mocktail *mocktail = [Mocktail startWithContentsOfDirectoryAtURL:url];\n    mocktail[@\"foo\"] = @\"bar\";\n\n**4.** There is no step 7.\n\n## Mad props\n\nWhile `NSURLProtocol` has been around forever, its uses aren't obvious unless you read things like [@mattt](http://github.com/mattt)'s awesome [NSHipster blog post on the subject](http://nshipster.com/nsurlprotocol/). If you don't read NSHipster, you're missing out. It's great.\n\n## Contributing\n\nYour pull requests are welcome, but please don't take this too seriously. Remember, one of Mocktail's greatest features is its simplicity.

It is based on NSOperation / NSOperationQueue combo, which gives it additional features and safety. \n                 \n                 The highlights:\n                 \n                 * Two .m files and .h files. Just drag to your project and go. You can also use CocoaPods.\n                 * Asynchronous download and disk read gives it an unmatched speed.

It depends on the following Apple frameworks:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t* Foundation.framework\n\t\t\t\t\t* UIKit.framework\n\n\t\t\t\t\t##Including MHTextField to your project\n\n\t\t\t\t\t### Source files\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can directly add the `MHTextField.h` and `MHTextField.m` source files to your project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Download the latest zip from github or clone the source in your desired directory.\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Open your project in Xcode, then drag and drop `MHTextField.h` and `MHTextField.m` onto your project (use the \"Product Navigator view\"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project. \n\t\t\t\t\t3.

It depends on the following Apple frameworks:\n\n\t\t\t\t* Foundation.framework\n\t\t\t\t* UIKit.framework\n\n\t\t\t\t##Including MHRadialProgressView to your project\n\n\t\t\t\t### Source files\n\n\t\t\t\tYou can directly add the `MHRadialProgressView.h` and `MHRadialProgressView.m` source files to your project.\n\n\t\t\t\t1. Download the latest zip from github or clone the source in your desired directory.\n\t\t\t\t2. Open your project in Xcode, then drag and drop `MHRadialProgressView.h` and `MHRadialProgressView.m` onto your project (use the \"Product Navigator view\"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project. \n\t\t\t\t3. Include MHRadialProgressView with `#import \"MHRadialProgressView.h\"`.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t### Cocoapods\n\t\t\t\t[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add MHTextField to your project.\n\n\t\t\t\t1. Add a pod entry for MHRadialProgressView to your Podfile `pod 'MHTextField', '~> 0.0.1'`\n\t\t\t\t2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.\n\t\t\t\t3. Include MHTextField with `#import \"MHRadialProgressView.h\"`\n\n\n\t\t\t\t## Usage \n\t\t\t\t1. Initialize the view with steps that define a particular operation complete.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tself.progressView = [[MHRadialProgressView alloc] \tinitWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 150, 150) points:@[@5, @10, @2, @9]];\n\n\t\t\t\t2. Add it as subview:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[self.view addSubview:self.progressView];\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3. Make progress by calling the following method:\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[self.progressView moveNext];\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBy default, the progress view displays % value. However you can override the style by calling the following method:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Default is MHProgressStylePercentage. Sets the progress style\n\t\t\t\t\t- (void)setProgressStyle:(MHProgressStyle)style;\n\n\t\t\t\tIt is also possible to format the label that displays the progress value using the folloiwng method:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- (void)setLabelWithFormat:(NSString*)format;\n\n\t\t\t\tFor unordered progres (often by steps associated wtih user action), you can increase the progress by value:\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- (void) moveNext:(NSNumber*)value;\n\n\t\t\t\t## License\n\n\t\t\t\tThis code is distributed under the terms and conditions of the [MIT license](LICENSE). \n","homepage":"https://github.com/mehfuzh/MHRadialProgressView","screenshots":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehfuzh/MHRadialProgressView/master/ScreenShots/placeit.png","license":"MIT","authors":{"Mehfuz Hossain":"mehfuz@gmail.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/mehfuzh/MHRadialProgressView.git","tag":"0.0.1"},"source_files":"MHRadialProgressView/Classes/MHRadialProgressView.{h,m}","requires_arc":true},"MHPrettyDate":{"name":"MHPrettyDate","version":"1.1.1","summary":"An iOS framework that provides a simple mechanism to get  \"Pretty Dates\" (\"Yesterday\", \"Today\", etc.) from NSDate objects.","homepage":"https://github.com/bobjustbob/MHPrettyDate","license":"MIT","authors":{"Bobby Williams":"bjackw@mac.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/bobjustbob/MHPrettyDate.git","tag":"v1.1.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source_files":"MHPrettyDate/**/*.{h,m}","resources":"MHPrettyDate/**/*.{lproj}","requires_arc":true,"frameworks":"Foundation"},"MHNibLoading":{"name":"MHNibLoading","version":"0.1.0","summary":"Simple UIView category for creating instances from nibs","description":"                   MHNibLoading aims to eliminate some of boilerplate code commonly seen when loading UIViews from a nib on disk.

M13InfiniteTabBar solves this problem by having all the view controllers on a single level. The \"extra\" view controllers can be reached by scrolling the tab bar left or right. The scrolling does pose a problem though, in which direction is my offscreen tab? M13InfiniteTabBar solves this by putting the tabs in an infinite scrolling loop. Any tab can be reached by scrolling in any direction.

It internally manages multiple simultaneous location requests, and each request specifies its own desired accuracy level and timeout duration. INTULocationManager automatically starts location services when the first request comes in, and stops location services once all requests have been completed.\n\n  ## What's wrong with CLLocationManager?\n  The CLLocationManager API works best when you need to track changes in the user's location over time, such as for turn-by-turn GPS navigation apps. However, if you just need to ask \"Where am I?\" every now and then, CLLocationManager is fairly difficult to work with. Getting these one-off location updates is a common task for many apps, such as when you want to autofill an address from the current location, or determine which city the user is currently in.\n\n  INTULocationManager makes it easy to request the device's current location, with a single API method that allows you to specify how accurate of a location you need, and how long you're willing to wait to get it. INTULocationManager is power efficient and conserves the user's battery by powering down location services (e.g. GPS) as soon as they are no longer needed.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/intuit/LocationManager","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"LICENSE"},"authors":{"Tyler Fox":"tyler_fox@intuit.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/intuit/LocationManager.git","tag":"v1.0.1"},"source_files":"Source","platforms":{"ios":"6.0"},"requires_arc":true},"INKeychainAccess":{"name":"INKeychainAccess","version":"1.0","summary":"[Deprecated] Keychain services wrapper for OS X and iOS.","homepage":"https://github.com/indragiek/INKeychainAccess","authors":{"Indragie Karunaratne":"indragiek@gmail.com"},"source_files":"*.{h,m}","source":{"git":"https://github.com/indragiek/INKeychainAccess.git","tag":"v1.0"},"license":"BSD","frameworks":"Security"},"INDockableWindow":{"name":"INDockableWindow","version":"1.0","summary":"A window to which other views can be docked to and separated into their own windows ","homepage":"https://github.com/indragiek/INDockableWindow","authors":{"Indragie Karunaratne":"i@indragie.com"},"source_files":"INDockableWindow","source":{"git":"https://github.com/indragiek/INDockableWindow.git","tag":"v1.0"},"platforms":{"osx":null},"requires_arc":true,"license":{"type":"MIT"},"dependencies":{"INAppStoreWindow":[]}},"INAppStoreWindow":{"name":"INAppStoreWindow","version":"1.4","summary":"Mac App Store style NSWindow subclass.","homepage":"https://github.com/indragiek/INAppStoreWindow","authors":{"Indragie Karunaratne":"i@indragie.com"},"source_files":"INAppStoreWindow","source":{"git":"https://github.com/indragiek/INAppStoreWindow.git","tag":"v1.4"},"platforms":{"osx":null},"requires_arc":true,"license":{"type":"BSD","text":"INAppStoreWindow is licensed under the BSD license."}},"IMQuickSearch":{"name":"IMQuickSearch","version":"0.5.0","summary":"Filtering your NSArrays of NSObjects like a BOSS.","authors":{"Ben Gordon":"benjamin.gordon@intermarkgroup.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/Intermark/IMQuickSearch.git","tag":"0.5.0"},"homepage":"http:/github.com/Intermark","license":"License","source_files":"Classes/*.{h,m}","platforms":{"ios":null}},"IMOStyledTableViewController":{"name":"IMOStyledTableViewController","version":"0.0.3","summary":"Style sheet based like Table View Controller.","homepage":"https://github.com/fredericcormier/IMOStyledTableViewController","platforms":{"ios":null},"authors":{"Frederic Cormier":"fred@i-mo.eu"},"license":"MIT","description":"An easy-to-customize style sheet based like Table View Controller.","source":{"git":"https://github.com/fredericcormier/IMOStyledTableViewController.git","tag":"0.0.3"},"source_files":["IMOStyledTableViewController/*.{h,m}","IMOStyledTableViewController/IMOStyledTableViewCells/*.{h,m}"],"requires_arc":true},"IMOAutocompletionViewController":{"name":"IMOAutocompletionViewController","version":"1.0.2","summary":"Very fast autocompletion UITableView based controller.","homepage":"https://github.com/fredericcormier/IMOAutocompletionViewController","platforms":{"ios":null},"authors":{"Frederic Cormier":"fred@i-mo.eu"},"license":"MIT","source":{"git":"https://github.com/fredericcormier/IMOAutocompletionViewController.git","tag":"1.0.2"},"source_files":"IMOAutocompletionViewControllerDEMO/IMOAutocompletionViewControllerDEMO/IMOAutocompletionViewController/*.{h,m}"},"IMAPClient":{"name":"IMAPClient","version":"0.0.2","license":"MIT","summary":"An asynchrounous IMAP client for iOS.","homepage":"https://github.com/bcoe/IMAPClient","authors":{"bcoe":"bencoe@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/bcoe/IMAPClient.git","tag":"0.0.2"},"platforms":{"ios":null},"source_files":["Classes","Classes/**/*.{h,m}"]},"ILTranslucentView":{"name":"ILTranslucentView","version":"0.0.1","license":"MIT","summary":"ILTranslucentView is a little subclass of UIView that provide native iOS 7+ blur effect.","description":"ILTranslucentView is a little subclass of UIView that provide native iOS 7+ blur (translucent) effect.

While it does not inherit UIProgressView, its API is quite similar.\n\n                  The view is graphically very simple, consisting of only a background circle and a coloured arc:\n\n                  ![A CERoundProgressView on its own](http://www.ceroce.com/github/CEProgressView/ProgressViewAlone.png)\n\n                  However, used in conjunction with other elements, it becomes quite interesting. For example, the sample program uses it as the background of a button which uses an image, transparent in some parts:\n\n                  ![A CERoundProgressView used with a button](http://www.ceroce.com/github/CEProgressView/ProgressViewWithButton.png)\n\n\n                  ### Particular Features ###\n\n                  * The change of progress is animated.\n                  * Colours can be set, either individually or through the UIAppearance proxy.\n\n\n                  ## How to use ##\n\n                  Drag the following files to your Xcode project:\n                  * CERoundProgressView.h and .m\n                  * CERoundProgressLayer.h and .m\n\n                  Because the progress view uses Core Animation, your target must also link with the QuartzCore framework.\n\n                  ### Duration of the animation ###\n                  I could not find a way to add a custom animatable property to a UIView. As a result, the following sample code has no effect on the animation's duration:\n\n                    [UIView animateWithDuration:3.0 animations:^{\n                      self.roundProgressView.progress = 12.0;\n                    }];\n\n                  Therefore, CERoundProgressView an animationDuration property was added for that purpose.\n\n                  ## Compatibility ##\n\n                  CERoundProgressView is compatible with iOS 5 and iOS 6.\n\n                  #### Automatic Reference Counting ####\n                  ARC is not enabled in the sample project, and the classes manage memory the old way.\n\n                  If ARC is activated in your project, the compiler will complain about the -dealloc method in CERoundProgressLayer.m. You should disable ARC for this file using the -fno-objc-arc compiler flag.\n\n                  #### Older SDKs ####\n\n                  CERoundProgressView makes use of the UIAppearance API which is only available from iOS 5.0. Should you want to link with older SDKs, you may modify CERoundProgressView.h so the class does not conform to the UIAppearanceContainer protocol, and its properties are not declared as UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR.\n\n                  ## Sample project ##\n\n                  The sample program shows a button which toggles between Play and Pause. The CERoundProgressView is below it.\n\n                  * CEPlayer is the most interesting class. It makes its position evolve from 0 to 1 on a duration of 20 seconds. The position changes abruptly every 0.5 s, on purpose: you can notice that the slider jumps from value to value, while the progress view animates smoothly.\n\n                  * CEViewController is the delegate of CEPlayer. Its  purpose is to catch the actions of the button and set the progress of the slider and the progress view.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/Ceroce/CERoundProgressView","license":{"type":"MIT","file":"README.markdown"},"authors":{"Renaud Pradenc":"info@renaudpradenc.com"},"platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/Ceroce/CERoundProgressView.git","commit":"8282b0ef0ea82d55a0040336a93a5e7904bf6666"},"source_files":["RoundProgress/CERoundProgressLayer.{h,m}","RoundProgress/CERoundProgressView.{h,m}"],"frameworks":["UIKit","QuartzCore"],"requires_arc":false},"CEPopupPickerView":{"name":"CEPopupPickerView","version":"0.1","license":"MIT","summary":"A UIPickerView that pops up, just like the Facebook app.","homepage":"https://github.com/chriseidhof/CEPopupPickerView","authors":{"Chris Eidhof":"chris@eidhof.nl"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/chriseidhof/CEPopupPickerView.git","tag":"v0.1"},"platforms":{"ios":null},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"CEPopupPickerView/CEPopupPickerView.{h,m}"},"CDZQRScanningViewController":{"name":"CDZQRScanningViewController","version":"1.0.7","summary":"Easy QR code scanning on iOS 7.","homepage":"https://github.com/cdzombak/CDZQRScanningViewController","license":"MIT","authors":{"Chris Dzombak":"chris@chrisdzombak.net"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cdzombak/CDZQRScanningViewController.git","tag":"v1.0.7"},"platforms":{"ios":"7.0"},"source_files":"*.{h,m}","public_header_files":"CDZQRScanningViewController.h","frameworks":["AVFoundation","UIKit"],"requires_arc":true},"CDZPinger":{"name":"CDZPinger","version":"1.0.1","summary":"Easy-to-use ICMP Ping for iOS (and maybe OSX).","homepage":"https://github.com/cdzombak/CDZPinger","license":"MIT","authors":{"Chris Dzombak":"chris@chrisdzombak.net"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cdzombak/CDZPinger.git","tag":"v1.0.1"},"platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source_files":"*.{h,m}","public_header_files":"CDZPinger.h","frameworks":"CFNetwork","requires_arc":true},"CDZLinkOpenManager":{"name":"CDZLinkOpenManager","version":"1.0","summary":"Simple facility for your app's users to select a default alternative browser (Safari, Chrome, 1Password).","homepage":"https://github.com/cdzombak/CDZLinkOpenManager","license":"MIT","authors":{"Chris Dzombak":"chris@chrisdzombak.net"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cdzombak/CDZLinkOpenManager.git","tag":"v1.0"},"platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source_files":"*.{h,m}","public_header_files":["CDZLinkOpenManager.h","CDZBrowserSelectorViewController.h"],"requires_arc":true},"CDTDatastore":{"name":"CDTDatastore","version":"0.0.5","summary":"CDTDatastore is a document datastore which syncs.","description":"                    CDTDatastore is a JSON document datastore which speaks the\n                    Apache CouchDB(tm) replication protocol.\n\n                    * Replicates with Cloudant and CouchDB.\n","homepage":"http://cloudant.github.io/cloudant-sync-eap","license":{"type":"Apache","text":"Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n"},"authors":{"Cloudant, Inc.":"support@cloudant.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore.git","tag":"0.0.5"},"platforms":{"ios":"6.0","osx":"10.8"},"requires_arc":true,"source_files":"Classes/**/*.{h,m}","exclude_files":"Classes/vendor/MYUtilities/*.{h,m}","prefix_header_contents":["#import \"CollectionUtils.h\"","#import \"Logging.h\"","#import \"Test.h\""],"ios":{"exclude_files":"Classes/osx"},"osx":{"exclude_files":"Classes/ios"},"dependencies":{"FMDB":[">= 2.2"]},"frameworks":"SystemConfiguration","libraries":["sqlite3","z"],"subspecs":[{"name":"no-arc","source_files":"Classes/vendor/MYUtilities/*.{h,m}","requires_arc":false,"ios":{"exclude_files":"Classes/vendor/MYUtilities/MYURLHandler.{h,m}"}}]},"CDSParticleFilter":{"name":"CDSParticleFilter","version":"0.5","summary":"Implements a particle filter in Objective C","description":"                   CDSParticleFilter implements a simple particle filter in Objective C,\n                   for use on iOS or OSX platforms.

in mind, asynchronous and modular.  \n                    Doing work asynchronously allows to keep your application responsive. \n                    But parallel programming is hard. On iOS, tools like GCD and NSOperation makes it much simpler but, \n                    for complex workflows it still takes time and resources to achieve. \n                    BkTask allows you to simply run workflows in background and be notified once it is done.  \n\n                    What about modularity then ? One way to simply a complex task is to breaking it into multiple simple steps. \n                    That is how you build a task with BkTask, by adding the steps you need to complete your workflow. \n                    If your workflow changes, add or remove steps to update it. You can even create your own steps and reuse them in different workflows. \n                    The modular aspect of BkTask helps you to stay agile.\n\n                    On the technical side, it is built using technologies like NSOperation and key-value observing.  \n                    This library is already used in AppStore applications used by millions of people. \n                   \n","homepage":"http://backelite.github.io/BkTask/","license":{"type":"MIT"},"authors":"Backelite","platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/Backelite/BkTask.git","tag":"0.9"},"source_files":["BkTask/Classes","BkTask/Classes/**/*.{h,m}"],"exclude_files":"Classes/Exclude","public_header_files":"BkTask/Classes/*.h","requires_arc":true},"Bitlyzer":{"name":"Bitlyzer","version":"2.0.0","platforms":{"ios":"5.0"},"summary":"Class to shorten URLs with Bit.ly on iOS (both block based and delegate based using ARC).","homepage":"https://github.com/albertodebortoli/Bitlyzer","authors":{"Alberto De Bortoli":"albertodebortoli.website@gmail.com"},"source":{"git":"https://github.com/albertodebortoli/Bitlyzer.git","tag":"2.0.0"},"license":{"type":"New BSD License","file":"LICENSE.markdown"},"source_files":"Src/Bitlyzer.{h,m}","requires_arc":true},"Bingo":{"name":"Bingo","version":"0.1.0","summary":"Baidu InHouse Library","description":"Bingo is a inhouse library current only avaiable for Baidu Inc, We may release it when it grow stable.
